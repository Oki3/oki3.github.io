# CSS Grid and Flexbox Mastery

Master the art of modern CSS layout with Grid and Flexbox. Learn how to create responsive and flexible layouts with these powerful tools.

## CSS Grid

Grid is perfect for two-dimensional layouts:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}

.grid-item {
  background: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 8px;
}
```

## Flexbox

Flexbox excels at one-dimensional layouts:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 20px;
}

.flex-item {
  flex: 1 1 300px;
}
