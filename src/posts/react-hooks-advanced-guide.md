# React Hooks Advanced Guide

React Hooks have revolutionized how we write React components. This guide will help you master advanced hook patterns and best practices.

## Custom Hooks

Creating custom hooks is a powerful way to share logic between components:

```javascript
function useWindowSize() {
  const [size, setSize] = useState({
    width: window.innerWidth,
    height: window.innerHeight
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      setSize({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight
      });
    };

    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);

  return size;
}
```

## Advanced Patterns

1. Compound Hooks
2. Hooks with Context
3. Hooks with Reducers
4. Hooks with Memoization

## Performance Optimization

- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Use `useCallback` for function memoization
- Use `useRef` for mutable values
- Use `useLayoutEffect` for DOM measurements

## Common Pitfalls

- Hooks Rules
- Dependency Arrays
- Stale Closures
- Infinite Loops

## Best Practices

- Keep hooks focused and single-purpose
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Follow the rules of hooks
- Test your custom hooks
- Document your hooks
